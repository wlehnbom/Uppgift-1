            <p>The African elephant is the largest land animal on earth, with males weighing up to 6,000 kg and females weighing up to 4,500 kg. They are known for their large gray bodies, long trunks, and big ears. African elephants are found throughout sub-Saharan Africa and they are known to live in a variety of habitats, including savannas, forests, and deserts. They are herbivores, and they eat a wide variety of plants, including grasses, fruits, and tree bark. African elephants are known for their intelligence and social behavior, they live in tight-knit family groups led by a dominant female, known as the matriarch. Unfortunately, African elephants are facing a number of threats, including habitat loss, poaching for their ivory tusks, and human-wildlife conflict, which has led to a significant decline in their population. African elephants are highly social animals and they are known to live in large family groups, with the females and their young forming the core of the group. The females and their young are closely related, and they form strong bonds with each other. The males, on the other hand, tend to leave the group once they reach sexual maturity. They may form small bachelor groups or live alone for a period of time before seeking out a mate. African elephants are known for their advanced communication and problem-solving abilities. They use a variety of vocalizations, such as trumpets, barks, and rumbling sounds, to communicate with each other. They also use their trunks to communicate, both through touch and through the sense of smell. African elephants are also known for their memory and problem-solving abilities, they are able to remember the location of water sources and food for years. African elephants are also known for their strong family bonds, they mourn their dead and help each other, they also have a strong sense of empathy.</p>

            <h2>North Pacific Right Whale</h2>
            <img class="img-animal" src="images/rightwhale2.jpeg" alt="North Pacific Right Whale">
            <p>The North Pacific right whale is a critically endangered species that can be found in the waters off the coast of Alaska and Russia. They are also known to migrate to the waters off the coast of British Columbia, Canada and the northern Pacific Ocean. They are known to feed in the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea and their summer feeding grounds are off the coast of Alaska. They are known for their large black bodies, no dorsal fin, and large callosities on their heads. The North Pacific right whale is a slow swimmer and they are known to move in small family groups. they are also known to be vocal and use a variety of calls to communicate with each other. They are filter feeders and feed on small crustaceans such as copepods and krill. The population of North Pacific right whale is estimated to be around 30 individuals, unfortunately human activities like commercial whaling and entanglement in fishing gear have greatly impacted their population.The North Pacific right whale is a slow-moving and relatively solitary species, they are known to have a low reproductive rate and long calving intervals which makes their population recovery difficult. They are also known for their long migrations, they travel thousands of miles each year between their feeding and breeding grounds. Their diet consists mainly of copepods and krill, they filter large amounts of water through their baleen plates to obtain their food. Although they are not known to be aggressive, they are known to be curious and approach boats. They are also known to have a strong memory and are able to remember their feeding ground for long periods of time. The North Pacific right whale is protected under the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, but the population remains critically low. It's important to continue research, monitoring and conservation efforts to protect this species and their habitats.</p>

            <h2>Blue Whale</h2>
            <img class="img-animal" src="images/bluewhale2.jpeg" alt="Blue Whale">
            <p>The Blue whale, also known as the "gentle giant of the sea", is the largest animal on earth, with adults reaching lengths of up to 100 feet and weighing as much as 200 tons. They are known for their bluish-gray color and their distinctively long and slender shape. Blue whales are found in all of the world's oceans and they tend to migrate seasonally to different areas depending on food availability. In the Northern Hemisphere, they can be found off the coast of North America, such as Canada and the United States, as well as in the North Atlantic Ocean. They also migrate to the Arctic waters in the summer to feed on krill. In the Southern Hemisphere, they can be found off the coast of South America, such as Chile and Peru, as well as in the South Atlantic and South Indian Ocean. Blue whales are filter feeders and they feed mainly on krill, consuming up to 4 tons of krill a day. Unfortunately, Blue whales have been hunted to near extinction in the past century and their population remains low. They are now protected under different international laws, but the population still needs to be closely monitored to ensure their recovery. Blue whales are known for their vocalizations, they produce the loudest sound of any animal, which can reach up to 188 decibels. These vocalizations are used for communication and for navigation. They are also known for their long migrations, they travel thousands of miles each year between their feeding and breeding grounds. Blue whales have a distinct population structure, they are divided into different subpopulations, each with their own vocal dialects, feeding and breeding patterns. Blue whales are also known for their slow reproduction rate, females only give birth to one calf every 2-3 years and they have a gestation period of 11-12 months. The calf will stay with the mother for about a year and will gain about 200 pounds a day during this time. Blue whales are also known for their intelligence and social behavior, they have been observed exhibiting different behaviors such as spy-hopping and breaching. Conservation efforts are crucial for the recovery of Blue Whale population, protection of their habitats, and monitoring of their population numbers is needed to ensure their survival.</p>
